## Hi there 👋

# 👋 About Me

I graduated in **Business Information Technology**, equipped with a solid foundation in statistics, critical thinking, and a strong passion for solving real-world problems through data-driven methodologies.

I'm deeply fascinated by how data can uncover hidden insights and drive meaningful decisions. My career goal is to become a **Data Analyst** or **Business Intelligence Specialist**, while continuously learning and expanding into related domains.
